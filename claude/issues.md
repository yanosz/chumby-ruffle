Title: Rendering regression in upstream.
Status: open
Description: After rebasing to upstream (8328af42d / 2026-07-12), the keyboard
in the SHOUTcast search could no longer be used; the control panel feels
sluggish. Cause unknown — not bisected. None of the 59 commits since 7f62f5dbf
touches the renderer or AVM1, but that does not rule a commit out. It may also
be that llvmpipe on one thread has no headroom left and any slightly heavier
binary tips it over. Not reportable upstream in this configuration. Workaround:
upstream rebased to 7f62f5dbf / 2026-07-06, shipped as 0.9.2. Recheck the
keyboard on every future rebase.
